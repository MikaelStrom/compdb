Requires Qt 5.2 or higher (developed on Qt5.7). 


Build on Linux
--------------

$ qmake -config release
$ make


Build on OS X
-------------

To create the app placed in a compdb.dmg with bundled frameworks, do

$ make -f Makefile.tasks dmg

Note that Qt-path is hardcoded in the Makefile.tasks and might need to be adjusted.


To cross compile from Linux to a staticly linked 32-bit Windows executable:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First install MXE

$ git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git
$ sudo mv mxe /opt
$ cd /opt/mxe
$ make qtbase

To build Windows executable

$ make -f Makefile.tasks win

The static executable is found in directory release.  Test with

$ wine release/compdb.exe

Eecutable runs on Windows 7 and up, 32 and 64-bit. 
Qt5 wont work with XP unless built from source with som special flags.
