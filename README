Requires Qt 5.2. 

To build natively on Linux and OSX (MinGW not tested, but should work):

$ qmake -config release
$ make

To cross compile from Linux to a staticly linked 32.bit Windows executable:

$ git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git
$ sudo mv mxe /opt
$ cd /opt/mxe
$ make qtbase
$ cd <compdb directory>
$ make clean
$ export PATH=/opt/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH
$ /opt/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/qt5/bin/qmake
$ make

The static executable is found in release/, test with

$ wine release/compdb.exe

Eecutable runs on Windows 7 and up, 32 and 64-bit. 
Qt5 wont work with XP unless built from source with som special flags.
